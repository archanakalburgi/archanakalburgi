Hi there! 👋 I am a machine learning and data engineering enthusiast. I recently completed my master's degree in machine learning, during which I took courses in a variety of related subjects such as machine learning, data mining, Python programming, deep learning, database management systems, and natural language processing. I am passionate about staying up-to-date on the latest developments in these fields and enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights through my blog, TukTuk.

I have gained deeper insights into machine learning algorithms through these projects
