I am **Archana Kalburgi**, currently I am invested in learning data structure and algorithms and how to tackle interview coding questions as I am looking for full-time opportunities. You can find my learnings related to the same [here](https://github.com/archanakalburgi/Algorithms) and [here](https://archanakalburgi.github.io/code_challenges/). My learnings related to Machine learning can be found at [TukTuk](https://archanakalburgi.github.io/tuktuk/) üê¢ 

Some of the courses I have completed includes Machine Learning: Fundamental and applications, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Python Programming, Deep Learning, Introduction to Deep Learning and Business Applications, DBMS, Web Mining. I am currently invested in learning NLP techniques and concepts.

I have gained deeper insights into machine learning algorithms through course project works
